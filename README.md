# Mp3ipe

Basic python music player made for not demanding folks, that just want to listen to their music :3

## Requirements

To fully use Mp3ipe you will need to install some dependencies on your unix-like machine!

**1. python** - Pretty obvious why it's there...

**2. ffmpeg** - It is the core of playing sound!

**3. mpv** - It is the music player I chose to build this on!

**4. tiv** - It is the terminal image viewer I chose for album covers!

## Manual

**1. Configure:** You can achive this by editing main.py and modifying CONFIG variable.

**2. Use:** You will need to execute this file so go in terminal and type: `python main.py`, without parameters it will just display the contents of your music library that you defined in CONFIG variable. Otherwise if you use parameters, so: `python main.py Paranoid Android` (this is an example) Mp3ipe will find your song and play it!

**3. Fork:** You can make your own fork of Mp3ipe if you want to implement your own features, and I'd love it!

## FAQ

### Will there be a support for MS Windows?
No, I am not interested in developing software compatible with this operating system, at least not for this project.
